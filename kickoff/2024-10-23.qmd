## Misc MUD + Admin
* Github classroom teams is broken at the moment. See Canvas for our PS3 workaround. Hope to have it fixed for remaining problem sets.
* What is a good set of reference material to use after class? Textbooks!
* What are expectations for calendar/time allocation?
    * Weekly PS until Thanksgiving (last one due 11/16)
    * Final project akin to an extended, less structured PS (present in class 12/2-12/5)
    * Study for final (12/12)

## git
- “I still have no clue why we are learning git”
- How do I handle merge conflicts?
- Show the command line. Change directory, list files (`ls` or `dir`). git status, git commit, and git log.
- Tech setup
    - By now, you should have command line git installed 
    - If you want to get ahead for the do-pair-share, fork https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/merge_example on github.com and then clone the repo to your computer
