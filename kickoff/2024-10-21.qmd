## MUD
* *When to winsorize?* When you have an observation which has reasonable values for almost all variables, but is an extreme outlier for just one variable.
\vspace{2ex}
    * Regression: you want to include that observation but don't want the estimates to be affected by the outlier
    \vspace{2ex}
        * If you set that cell to NA, the entire observation drops out of the regression.
    *  Summary statistics: you want to report the same number of observations across all your descriptive statistics
    \vspace{2ex}
        * If you set that cell to NA, your summary statistic for that variable will have fewer observations than for the other variables.
    * Often used for variables that extreme extreme skewness: healthcare costs 
    
    
## Curriculum
* Finishing up visualization in the first half of today
* Remaining 1.5 lectures this week are on version control

## Problem Sets
* Two problem sets released later today, will send a Canvas announcement when they are live.
* PS3: Git -- due 10/26
\vspace{2ex}
    * Half solo, half paired
    * Should be shorter than PS1 and PS2
