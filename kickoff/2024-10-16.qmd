## Ahead of today's lecture
* If you haven't already: `pip install palmerpenguins` 

## New student repo
* New student repo:  [https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/student30538  (link)](https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/student30538)
* You will have to fork it again (see instructions in README.md)
* Simpler structure: just one branch, with separate folders for `before_lecture` and `after_lecture`

## Tip from Ed
* Jakub found a cool extension for viewing and cleaning data in VSCode (similar to RStudio)
* [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-wrangler (link)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-wrangler)

## MUD concerns about workload
* We removed a section from PS2. Revised version is in student repo.
* We are adding office hours this week
    * Akbar over zoom on Friday
    * Joaquin in person Thursday
    * *You will get priority if you post your question to the office hours thread on Ed before you come*
* Looking forward, PS3 is shorter than PS1 or PS2 as best as we can tell

## MUD other
* Will we require that you transform your dataset in `altair` or `pandas`? _Answer: no, use what works best for you_
* Can `altair` functions (e.g., `transform_filter()`) be used outside of `altair`? _Answer: no, altair only transforms within the plot it's making_
* Final project: why just one member present? _Answer: presentation slots are 8 minutes and we want to reduce transition time. _
* Challenges debugging -- we will do a mini-lesson on this next week
* Good questions we will have answers to by Monday (but don't have yet, sorry!)
    * What is a concrete example of a time/setting when winsorizing would be the best path for handling outliers
    * Adding better axis labels (motivated by the `diamonds` histogram for `carat`)

## Final Project Optional Meetings
* Preferred but not required: send questions in advance via private Ed post tagged "Final project Ganong"
* Ganong's sections: Next week *during* lab in room 0049. Will have a signup at the start of lab.
* Shi's sections: office hours.
